Make Jetpack's Holiday Snow feature accessible by only showing it if user has opted-in by clicking a snowflake displayed on the page.

== Description ==

Make Jetpack's Holiday Snow feature accessible by only showing it if user has opted-in by clicking a snowflake displayed on the page. Users can also disable the snow if they get tired of it by clicking the snowflake again. The snow is disabled by default, and the snow status is stored in a cookie so it will remain on or off until the user decides.

Requires Jetpack (obviously)

If you're a user and interested in being able to block the Jetpack Holiday Snow from loading on any site you visit, check out my Chrome Extension: [Block Holiday Snow](https://github.com/jjeaton/block-holiday-snow).
